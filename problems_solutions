PROBLEMS
--------

#1 - When creating a new sqlite database we have to manually make sure that it has the right permissions.
#2 - Concatenating query gives a litle margin for sql injection even using mysql_real_escape_string().
#3 - Due to several external setbacks last commit was made after the time limit.
#4 - url rewritting was not taken in consideration.


SOLUTIONS
---------

#1 - CSRF filter was done with resource to a session variable.
#2 - XSS filter was done with resource to strip_tags().
#3 - SQL Injection filter was done with resource to mysql_real_escape_string().
#4 - MVC Design pattern used in the App.
